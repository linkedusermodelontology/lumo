# The Linked User Model Ontology (LUMO) - version 3.0
LUMO continues to be extended in the premises of the [Hyper360](http://www.hyper360.eu/) H2020 project, focused on detailing the middle layer of several media domains, already supported at the high-level in the previous version of the ontology. Current extensions serve the purpose of semantic classification of user transactions and 360 video spatio-temporal fragments, based on raw textual metadata.

This version is an expansion of LUMO v2.0. Changes include more atomic and complex concepts (axioms) to effectively cover the music and social events domains and the sports and health/exercise domain. 

For more information about LUMO v3.0, please refer to [Deliverable D4.1](link to come) of the Hyper360 project .

## Mappings
Mappings to ontologies have remained the same for the current version.
